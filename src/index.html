      <h2>Power Pro Equipment</h2>
      <div class="accentBar"></div>
      <p>Jim Martin, with PowerPro Equipment in New Holland, Pennsylvania, has a long history with Hustler Turf Equipment. He started
      retailing Hustler products in 1975 when he joined PowerPro.</p>
      <p>PowerPro (which has a total of six locations) added the Hustler MDV to their offering in March 2017 and have had a lot of
      success in retailing the units. To date, they have sold 14 MDV’s. Jim credits a lot of that success to physically taking
      the vehicle out to potential customers and demo’ing it so they can see how it works. He feels this goes a long way in helping
      them visualize how it could be applied to their business.</p>
      <h5 class="pullQuote">“I come from the old school where sales people go out on the road. We scope out colleges, schools, municipalities, parks and bring the equipment to them.”</h5>
      <p>Demo'ing the equipment “is especially important with the MDV because there’s a lot of UTV’s out there.
      But, not one of those UTV’s has the LeveLift bed technology. The key is showing it and getting people to think about how
      they could use it in their operation and all the benefits it could bring.”</p>
      <p>One unexpected customer in his area that has garnered a lot of interest are retirement homes.</p>
      <p>“In Pennsylvania, there are a lot of retirement facilities and these places are constantly moving things around like washing
      machines, refrigerators, etc.,” says Jim. “With the LeveLift bed technology, it makes the loading and the unloading of these
      items so much easier. They can literally take those items right up to the door of any house and easily transport it inside.”</p>
      <p>Another great customer opportunity Jim notes are schools and colleges who have the same type of equipment movement going
      on at their facilities.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, there’s not one limit to any application,” says Jim. “Sometimes you have to think out-of-the-box of how that customer
      could use it, but that’s where bringing it out to them and letting them see how it works makes a difference. Then, they can
      better visualize how it can help them in their business.”</p>
      <p>Jim says another great feature of the MDV that he loves to point out is the versatility of the cab. With long, cold winters
      in Pennsylvania, being able to offer the front mount snow blade and full cab with heat gives consumers the ability to turn
      it into a winter vehicle which he cites as another great selling point.</p>
      <p>“Being able to convert the vehicle so it can be a winter vehicle can really resonate with our customer base up here,” says
      Jim.</p>
      <p>One customer he worked with had 12 acres of wood land and bought it for hauling the firewood. He was amazed at how much easier
      it was to load firewood without having to lift the bundles over the side of his previous vehicle. “Some customers don’t want
      to spend the dollars for the LeveLift, but if they have a valuable use for it – like saving their backs - they can then see
      the value of spending the money for it”</p>
      <p>Other applications where Jim sees a use for the MDV are areas - like swampy terrain - where a truck or tractor would be too
      heavy or big to go into, but there’s still a need to load and/or unload heavy items.</p>
      <p>“If you look at the construction industry you know there are times they have items, like concrete blocks, where they need
      to transport them thru an area where a truck just can’t go,” says Jim. “Having the MDV to make that whole process easier
      can be a big value to a business like that.”</p>

      </div>
      <p>PowerPro has marketed the MDV throughout their locations extensively. They made a video for their website showing it being
      used in different applications. They have also advertised it in their local newspapers with photos capturing the machine
      in its lift and lower positions. They’ve also brought it to outdoor sports shows and farm shows – even the local town parade.</p>
      <p>“We think the MDV is a unique offering that has endless possibilities of the places where it can be used,” says Jim. “Truly,
      the sky's the limit here.”</p>

      <h2>MDV Maintenance Made Simple</h2>
      <div class="accentBar"></div>
      <p>Many catastrophic vehicle failures are a result of lack of maintenance. The Hustler development team focused specifically
      on making routine maintenance and general service as simple and accessible as possible with the MDV. Checking the oil, checking
      and changing the air filter, and accessing the battery can all be done through the side service access door without moving
      the bed. A remote mount oil filter positions the filter so that it can be easily accessed and drained without a mess. The
      LeveLift version allows oil to be added without requiring cargo to be unloaded. The removable front toolbox allows instant
      access to all front components allowing easy access for radiator cleaning or steering and suspension inspections.</p>

      <div class="accentBar"></div>
      <p class="wip">Article is a work in progress...</p>
      <p>Hustler is dedicated to helping promote the Hustler MDV during the all-important spring and fall time periods when UTV sales
      are ramping up. This past spring, the Hustler team launched a marketing campaign that involved a variety of tactics including
      digital, direct mail, email blasts, trade publication and television in areas where MDV dealers resided and targeted consumers
      either displayed or designed to focus on consumers with on-line characteristics that demonstrated they were interested in purchasing a utility
      vehicle. This included a variety of tactics including digital web banners, direct mail pieces, email blasts and trade and
      television advertising. Blah, blah, blah…</p>

      <h2>MDV Consumer Spotlight</h2>
      <div class="accentBar"></div>
      <p>We know there are all types of unique uses for the MDV. And, to gain more insight on this topic, Hustler Turf has been reaching
      out to MDV owners to learn some of the more interesting ways consumers and business owners are utilizing the LeveLift bed
      technology. Each issue we thought it’d be fun to share some of these stories:</p>

          <i>Exotic Feline Rescue Center – Center Point, IN</i>
        </p>
        <p class="noMarBottom bold">Dealer:</p>
        <p class="bold">
          <i>Crowder Lawn &amp; Garden – Rockville and Brazil, IN</i>
        </p>
        <p>With about 200 exotic felines calling the Exotic Feline Rescue Center (EFRC) home, the EFRC is one of the largest rescue
        centers in the United States for abused, unwanted and neglected exotic felines.</p>
        <p>Joe Taft is the founder and director of the center and bought his MDV this spring specifically for the LeveLift bed technology.</p>
        <p>“Many of the cats brought in here need medical/dental procedures,” says Joe. “We have a complete medical facility and once
        a year we have dentists who volunteer their time and talents to fly in here to work on our animals.”</p>
        <p>The process involves immobilizing the animals, carrying them on a stretcher and lifting them into the bed of a vehicle to
        transport them to their medical facility.</p>
        <p>“These cats can weigh 600 lbs and that is the high risk part of things – if one of the carriers suddenly finds that they
        can no longer hold their end, they can drop the animal which could injure the animal or the handler or both,” says Joe.</p>
        <p>With the LeveLift bed technology, the risky part of this process has been greatly reduced.</p>
        <p>“We bought it for that dental event, but even before that came around I’ve been using it and it works even better than I
        thought,” says Joe.</p>
        <p>Joe is also a consumer who is a great example of the Hustler MDV marketing plan driving foot traffic to one of our dealerships.
        He received his MDV postcard in the mail during the spring marketing campaign which peaked his interest. He then saw the
        Hustler television commercial with Crowder Implement’s ad selling the MDV. When he realized the dealer just a few miles away
        from his home, he marched down there and bought his MDV.</p>

          <i>Garden of Memories Cemetery – Pittsburg, KS</i>
        </p>
        <p class="noMarBottom bold">Dealer:</p>
        <p class="bold">
          <i>Bitner Motors – Pittsburg, KS.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Garden of Memories is a 10-acre cemetery owned by small-business owner Lori Lavery. She is also assisted by her grounds specialist,
        Joe Gorenc.</p>
        <p>Lori calls the MDV a “godsend” for female small business owners.</p>
        <p>“Because we run with a small staff, myself, the Grounds Specialist, and a part time employee, there are many tasks that I
        can now do on my own, without the “muscle” of my grounds guys,” says Lori. “Emptying trash cans – there was no way I could
        lift a big trash can over the bed of our previous UTV by myself. Now, with the MDV, this is one task I can do and that helps
        with distributing the workload for our business.”</p>
        <p>Another application in her business they are using the MDV for is transporting caskets.</p>
        <p>“A casket typically weighs 200-400 lbs,” says Lori. “With the MDV, we can easily put the casket into the bed without having
        to lift them. And then, once loaded we can easily transport it to its destination. Not having to lift an item that heavy
        has helped us immensely.”</p>
        <p>Her business also involves a lot of dirt work. However, with the bed lowering to the ground, that task has also been made
        easier as they can transfer dirt to the gravesite and simply dump and/or shovel the dirt easily onto the ground.</p>
        <p>“I rate the quality of the MDV as an overall “10” cause I can do so much more now in my business,” says Lori.</p>
